Asymptotic Index Recovery in Simplex Numbers
============================================
This repository contains an expository note presenting known results in a unified framework. Asymptotic properties of k-simplex numbers arising from their recursive polynomial structure is examined. The cumulative summation defining the k-simplex numbers produces separation of polynomial degree, yielding stabilising density limits under natural normalisations. These limits follow from dominance of the leading term. Inversion of the leading term provides asymptotically accurate index recovery, while a corrected estimator yields eventual exact inversion after applying the floor function.
